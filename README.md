# Activity Tracker
The Activity Tracker is a Python program that tracks the amount of time spent on various activities, such as working on a project or browsing the internet. It records the start and end times for each activity and stores them in a JSON file, which can be used to visualize the duration of each activity over time.

- Install virtualenv by running the following command: pip install virtualenv
- Create a new virtual environment by running the command: virtualenv venv
- Activate the virtual environment by running the command: source venv/bin/activate on Linux/Mac or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows.
- Install the required dependencies using pip: pip install -r requirements.txt
